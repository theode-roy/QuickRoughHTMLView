# QuickRoughHTMLView

Speedy hot-swappable SwiftUI HTML views for wherever it is necessary.

## Usage

QuickRoughHTMLView fetches from the target's bundle. This can be changed by modifying the framework yourself (...that's what open-source projects are for, right?)

```swift
QuickRoughHTMLViewContainer(htmlFilename: "test")
```

(QRHVExampleApp has a working demo HTML game attached to it, so if you're going to include the example app in your code for some reason, I suggest replacing the HTML with a less heavy alternative)
